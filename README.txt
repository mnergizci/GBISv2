This repository is temporary and will be moved to the NERC COMET GitHub (https://github.com/nerc-comet) in the near future (very soon).

The study is currently under review at JGR: Solid Earth. Please cite the preprint as follows:
Refining 3D Displacement Fields and Coseismic Slip Models of the 2023 Kahramanmaraş Earthquakes Using Subswath and Burst Overlap Interferometry (SBOI)
